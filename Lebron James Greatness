    <title>Best Player to Ever Play?
    </title>
</head>
<body>
<p><b>Lebron James has created himself a legacy that will be remembered for years to come. After playing for a total
of 16 years so far in his career. His undeniable skill in the paint makes him a versatile threat all over the court.
Throughout the years, he has dominated the game for multiple teams. Lebron started his journey as the number one pick in
    the draft for the Cavaliers even after not attending college. Being put on such a high expectation did not stop him
    from becoming a game changing player.
</b></p>
<p>Many predicted that Lebron"s game would eventually end sooner rather than later. However, Labron always has a knack
to stun the world. For example, history will forever tell the story of how Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers
came back from a 3-1 deficit against the all mighty Golden State Warriors. Without Lebron playing at a high level, there
was very little chance that they could out beat the Warriors three games in a row. As a final thought, no matter where
Lebron has played, the team acquiring the player has always excelled due to how much Lebron can contribute to the team.
A great example would be the Cavaliers who ,without him, have been playing at a less than subpar level this year
    (2018-2019).
