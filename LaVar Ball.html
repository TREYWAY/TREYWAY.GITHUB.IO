LaVar Ball has had quite a career in his journey and continues to thrive from the social media for his sons. Many
critics of LaVar considered him very "full of himself" when he manages to muster out the words "I can beat Michael
Jordan". Those are some true fighting words from a past NFL player who only averaged two points a game at Washington
State. While his antics and publicity stunts can be exaggerated, the one true task in his mind is to give his children
the opportunity to become highly sought after in the NBA. Already, Lonzo Ball has been in the NBA for a few years and
has become to hone in his skills to play basketball in the NBA. Being in LaVar Ball's footsteps, he couldn't be any
prouder of how his children have "stepped up to the plate" when the big opportunity is there. LaVar Ball is quite a
figure when he is on the spotlight and continues to represent his family in his company Big Baller Brand.
